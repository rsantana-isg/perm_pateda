"""
Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) for permutation-based EDAs

The QAP is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem where the goal
is to assign a set of facilities to a set of locations in such a way that
minimizes the total cost, which is the sum of the products of flow and distance
between facilities.

The QAP is NP-hard and has applications in facility location, keyboard design,
hospital layout, and scheduling.
